# LinePay
Waiting in line is a critical part of the service industry. Long lines at grocery stores, gas stations, or amusement parks are an inconvenience for anyone living in the fast paced 21st century. Americanâ€™s lives are busier than ever trying to sustain everything that society demands of them. We are always finding ways to make our day-to-day lives easier and smoother. However, the time spent waiting in line is valuable time that we simply cannot afford to waste. With the LinePay application, waiting in long lines is a thing of the past, and the time spent in line is cut in half. LinePay is a package that provides a new gig economy centered around buying/selling line positions and getting rid of physical ques by holding places in line using the LinePay app.
